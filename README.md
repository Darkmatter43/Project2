This is a full CRUD web application using node, express, mongo, mongoose, HTML, javascript, and css.

##Approach:
I tried to approach this from the perspective of users being able to contribute to a growing list of items. 
###User Stories
Users should be able to view descriptions of various weapons from video gaming history.
User should be able to create and log into their own accounts.
Users should be able to create their own entries for weapons with their own information.
Users should be able to edit the information of any weapons on the website.
Users should be able to remove weapons from the index page.
Users should be able to remove weapons from their personal page.
Users should be able to delete their account if they so choose.
When a weapon is deleted from the index, it should not delete from the user's page who created it.
When a user is deleted, their weapons should NOT delete from the index.

####Unsolved problems:
The only functionality I did not add was the basis of the idea for this project: I want the user to be able to add weapons from the index into their own page. During the creation of this app, I had so many other ideas along the way that I wanted to implement, that this feature was left to the wayside.
